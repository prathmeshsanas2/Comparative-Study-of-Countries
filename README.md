# Comparative-Study-of-Countries
 compare various parameters such as income, life insurance share, market share, penetration, ratio of reinsurance accepted, and retention ratio of different countries using the sample insurance dataset and world development indicators dataset.

# Objective: 

Create a dashboard to compare all the parameters mentioned above for different countries, to strategize market penetration and to target new customers.

Datasets:

Primary Dataset – Insurance Sample Dataset

Secondary Dataset – Global Financial Development Database

Note: Use Data Blending with Relationships between Country Code, Country, and Year

Steps to Perform: 

Create a geographic map showing the countries' fields. Color the map based on the income column from the secondary dataset

Include income group filter in the dashboard

Include a webpage to show data from the world bank webpage driven by an URL action from a geography graph

The country names in the map will act as the trigger

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country

Create a KPI Table to show the comparison between the selected period and the period prior to the selected one

Create two parameters for Year Selection and Category Selection

Category parameter includes life insurance share, market share, penetration, ratio of reinsurance accepted, and retention ratio

Create a calculated field to calculate the Growth %

Create a table to show these values

Title should be updated based on the category selection

Create Growth Indicator Shapes based on the Growth %

Growth indicator displays Negative, No Change, and Positive as values and corresponding shapes against it 

Create a trend line to show the selected category values

The line shows an arrow or triangle at the last mark

Create a dashboard filter for income group to be applied for all charts with the filter action enabled in the map as well

Formatting should be done appropriately
